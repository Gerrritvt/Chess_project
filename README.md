# Chess_project
Use chess data in order to send customized emails with performanse insights in played chess openings. 

# How to use
Run `src/everyday_mail.py` to request data and send an email, where credentials come from `src/credentials.py` which is in the gitignore file. 

I use https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ to run the file in a virtual environment daily, which is free of charge.

# Requirements
Libraries in `requirements.txt`.

## Example of an email:
